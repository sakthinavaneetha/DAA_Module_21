# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE: 07/05/2025
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm
1. Input: The board size N, starting position knightpos, and target position targetpos.
2. Define isInside(x, y, N): Check if a position (x, y) is within the board bounds.
3. Initialize a Queue: Start from the knightâ€™s position with a distance of 0, and use BFS.
4. BFS Exploration: Explore all 8 possible knight moves and add valid positions to the queue.
5. Output: Return the distance to the target when reached, or infinity if unreachable.

## Program:

            y = curr.y + dy[i]

    N = 30
    knightpos = [1, 1]
    targetpos = [30, 30]
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                               targetpos, N))
```

## Output:

## Result:
The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
